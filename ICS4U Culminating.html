								<h2>ICS4U Culminating Project: "Mind Mastery"</h2>
								<p>Designed and Programmed by Shiv Kanade and Caleb Chue</p>

									<strong>Game Theme</strong>
									<br>
									For the final project of the ICS4U course, the task was to effectively design,
									develop, and produce a game which would enable a specific audience to learn about
									a certain life challenge as well as solutions to surviving and overcoming it. 
									<br>
									For my game theme, I chose to address the challenge of living with Attention Disorders. 
									This topic appealed to me as I have seen the impacts of Attention Disorders up close.
									I have understood the gravity of the effects it has on the daily lives of people.
									Thus, I selected this topic to provide an informational yet engaging manner to inform 
									people about it. 
									<br>As this game is intended to inform the user about Attention disorder, 
									potential solutions to surviving them, as well as opportunities to apply solutions, I 
									produced the name "Mind Mastery" for the game. This name fits well as the goal of the 
									program is demonstrate the difficulties and process to taking control of one's life regardless
									of the Attention Disorders.
									<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Game Stages</strong>
									<br>
									The game, Mind Mastery, is designed to take the user through a systematic process to learning 
									about Attention Disorders and applying solutions to overcome them.

									Level 1: 
									<br>
									The learning level provides an interactive map through which the user can navigate to learn about
									the impacts of Attention Disorders and Solutions to survive them. All graphics in for the game were 
									designed from scratch using multiple softwares such as Adobe Photoshop and PixilArt.
									<br>
									One of the main challenges that was faced during the development of this level was the implmentation of
									messages that would be produced on screen whenever the user approached a sign or interacted with an NPC.

									Level 2: 
									<br>
									The maze level of the game provides the player an opportunity to apply the solutions they learnt in the
									previous level. Alongside completing tasks scattered around the map, the player faces an added challenge 
									of navigating an interesting maze.
									<br>
									One of the main challenges faced during the creation of this level was the implementation of tasks. The 
									main issue was the amount of time that each task required to development, as well as the necessity of 
									multiple tasks to make the level interesting.

									Level 3: 
									<br>
									The final level of the game is the action level. This level allows the user to engage in a fast paced game 
									where various objects continously fly across the screen. The user must focus on certain objects and ignore others, selecting
									the correct objects by clicking on them.
									<br>
									One of the main challenges faced during developing this level was the implmentation of a system to continously update the screen
									to create the illusion of translating objects. At first, I attempted to use Java threads in order to accomplish this, however soon 
									after switched to using an in built Timer class which was significantly easier to use.

									Overall, this task was quite interesting and enjoyable. The end result of this project met my goal, and I was able to create an enriching and engaging game.
