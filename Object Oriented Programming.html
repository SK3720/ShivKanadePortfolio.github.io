								<h2> Object Oriented Programming</h2>
								<p>A quick guide to understanding Object Oriented Programming and its usages.
								</p>
							</header>
							<p>
								<strong>What is Object Oriented Programming?</strong>
								<br>
								Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a method of programming which is focused on the
								creation of objects which contain data and have usable methods to carry out functions in
								a organized manner, and one that is more efficient.
								<br>
								<br>
								<u>Definitions</u>
								<li>Class: A description of an object type. While multiple objects can be created using
									this class, each object can have differentiating characters.</li>
								<li>Object: An object is an instance of a class that has an identity (Defines each
									object which distinguishes it from other objects), state (Values stored in variables
									which &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may be used to define the object),
									and a behavior (Methods which allow for specific functions to be carried out).</li>
								<li>Constructor: In order to create a new object in a class, constructors are used.
									Constructors have the same name as the class they are used in. They often contain
									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parameters (values) that are stored in
									variables which are then stored as part of each object that is created using the
									constructor. Thus, several objects may have a
									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;few identical values but can also contain
									other distinguishing attributes</li>

								<strong>Class Structure - How it is all connected:</strong>
								<br>
								To create a program following an OOP structure, the class is declared first. This is
								followed by a constructor, with the same name as the class, which may or may not contain
								parameters. A constructor with no parameters is called a default constructor. When the
								constructor is created with the desired attributes, object defined by this constructor
								can then be created.

									<strong>Class Structure - Example:</strong>
									<br>
									Example - Understanding how it works:
									For further clarification, the class structure in Java can be imagined as a cookie
									cutter in the shape of a tree. The constructor for the class gives each object/”cookie”
									its base defining attributes, such as its shape, while each object may still be unique
									through other attributes such as color and patterns. The image on the right provides a 
									visual representation of this.

								<strong>The Use of Unified Modeling Language</strong>
								<br>
								Unified Modeling Language (UML) allows us to understand the execution path and relations 
								between classes in a Java program. It prevents the developer from getting confused, and 
								lays out the information in a clear manner. Below is an example of a UML for a basic game structure.
								There are numerous multiple classes that exist for a simple game, as can be seen. Keeping track of these
								classes can become confusing very quickly, and thus a UML is used to prevent this.

									<strong>Java Inheritance:</strong>
									<br>
									Inheritance occurs in Java programming similar to as it does in real life. Classes can inherit properties/methods
									from other classes. The initial class is called the Parent Class/Superclass, and the class that inherits from it
									is called the Child Class/Subclass. While the parent class can only access its own methods, the subclass accesses
									all of its own methods as well as all of the methods of the superclass. Note that constructors are not inherited,
									however they can still be accessed using the keyword “super”.
