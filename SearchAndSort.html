									<strong>What is an Searching and Sorting?</strong>
									<br>
                                    Searching and Sorting refers to the process of locating elements based on a certain 
                                    defined restriction (Searching). Followed by that, the element is shifted to its 
                                    correct position based on the desired final output. For example, a set of integers in 
                                    an array can be sorted in a increasing or decreasing order.
                                    <br>
                                    There are many different algorithms that can be utilized to sort sets of values. These 
                                    algorithms differ based on the process they use to search and sort elements, and thus they
                                    have different time complexities as well as space complexities.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>What are Time and Space Complexities?</strong>
                                    <br>
                                    Time complexity refers to how long the algorithm takes to sort a given set of values. A 
                                    time complexity for an algorithm can be defined by its general time complexity, which is the
                                    average amount of time it takes to sort data. Each algorithm also has its own worst time complexity
                                    and best time complexity. 
                                    <br>
                                    Space complexity refers to how much memory space is required to sort data. This varies based on the 
                                    algorithm. For example, some algorithms are able to sort a set of data in an array by simply switching
                                    element values around within the array itself, such as Comb Sort. However, other algorithms may require
                                    a seperate temporary data structure to be created to sort the original range of values, such as Merge Sort.

                                        <strong>Sequential Search: A Useful Search Algorithm</strong>
                                        <br>
                                        Sequential Search is a unique searching algorithm which can quickly locate a desired value within a data 
                                        range. Sequential Search functions through a series of steps:
                                        <br>
                                        1. The array size is defined and set. The longer the array is, the greater the number of comparisons will be.
                                        <br>
                                        2. A target value is defined. This is the value which the algorithm will search for in the array.                                   
                                        <br>
                                        3. A for loop is created to pass through all elements in the array.
                                        <br>
                                        4. Each element value is compared with the target value, if a match is found, the for loop ends and the index 
                                        of the matching value is returned.
                                    </p>
